Credit Card Fraud Detector

This is an exercise from Kaggle to detect fraud using a normalized dataset that includes 28 feature excluding amount and time. Each record (row) representats a transaction that is either normal or fradulent which respectively ndicated by a class of 0 or 1.

After data was gathered, processed and visualized--a test set was parsed from the true set and a model was applied to the data to gather predictions. The results were analyzed and a confusion matrix applied to results to visualize precision, recall and F1 scores.

There is an obvious overfit to the data, so we will need to further apply normalization as well as look at other models, including NN to determine best fit.

The code attached is the beginning. Stop back again later.
