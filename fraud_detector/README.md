# Credit Card Fraud Detector

## This is to detect fraud using Kaggle's normalized dataset that includes 28 feature excluding transaction amount and time. 

Each record (row) is a transaction either labeled with Class 0 or 1, normal or fraud. Data was gathered, processed and visualized. A test set was parsed from the training data and an LR model applied. The results were analyzed and a confusion matrix applied to results to visualize precision, recall and F1 scores.

There is an obvious overfitting and I don't think the LR model is the best one for this imbalanced dataset. I would like to further apply normalization as well as look at other parameters and models. 

The code attached is the very beginning. Stop back again later.
